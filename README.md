# CS Ops Automation Toolkit

A lightweight automation toolkit built to connect **Jira, Gmail, and Google Sheets** into a single, reliable CS operations workflow.

This project focuses on turning everyday support chaos into structured, actionable data — with minimal manual effort.

---

## Why this exists

Support and operations teams live across multiple tools.

Tickets are in **Jira**, context is in **email**, tracking happens in **spreadsheets** —  
and too much time is lost stitching it all together.

This project was built to automate that glue.
